## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is the front end server for the web-application built as part of the COMP0022 group project.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the docker daemon installed to run the project. Al the other prerequisites will be installed when running.

### Installing

Install docker from the official website.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

How to run the automated tests for this system.

```
npm test
```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

In the project directory, you can run:

### `docker-compose up (--build)`
Runs the app inside a docker container (need to have the Docker daemon installed). Use --build when running for the first time (builds the container for the first time & installs the dependencies)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
